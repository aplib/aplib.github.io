## SIATM - Structural Identification Algorithm Text Markup
This is a project of compositional markup, a software platform and the concept of a unified working environment

It is based on the concept of document primary, everything as a document and document is everything, where all data, including code, models, and other artifacts,
are represented as documents, and all operations on these artifacts are performed through document manipulation.
And the user works with the document in the form of its visual representations, controls, and with text, as necessary to solve specific problems.

The SIATM model provides a unified approach to managing complex data
structures at all levels of software development, from building models and writing source code to creating databases, exchange protocols, and building high-level user interfaces.
It also provides a powerful tool for managing complex data structures in a flexible and efficient way, which can be used in a wide variety of applications and contexts.
