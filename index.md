## SIATM (Structural Identification Algorithm Text Markup)

This is a proposed project of a universal compositional markup, a software platform, a document-oriented database and protocols, and the concept of a single working environment.

It is based on the concept of document primacy, everything as a document and document is everything, where all data, including code, models, and other artifacts,
are represented as documents, and all operations on these artifacts are performed through document manipulation documents and object models of these documents.
And the user works with the document in the form of its visual representations, controls, and with text, as necessary to solve specific problems.

In this concept, of course, we mean not just a unary document, such as an XML file, a text document or a source code file, but the same document is an addressable information entity in a hierarchy of complexity,
which itself is a complex object and system with a complex composition, aspects and variants, but also consists of a system with other entities.

The SIATM model provides a unified approach and tool for the flexible and efficient management of complex data structures at all levels of software development,
 from building models and writing source code to creating databases, exchange protocols and building high-level user interfaces.

This project requires an organized approach for implementation, given its complexity and mathematical intricacies.
However, with the use of modern technologies, this is a very achievable and already partially developed project.
It is proposed to implement a project on .NET Core, which is an open source framework for building modern high-performance applications.
The project is open for participation, we invite interested parties to contact us for additional information and to join us in this exciting endeavor.
