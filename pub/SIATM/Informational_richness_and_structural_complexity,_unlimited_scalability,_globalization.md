## Informational richness and structural complexity of documents, unlimited scalability, globalization

With SIATM each document fragment can be associated with an additional block containing arbitrary information. 
This binding can be done by structural hierarchy, by strict reference, by name or algorithmically, by rules.
Thus, it is possible to expand the structure of the document in an arbitrary problem-oriented way, without violating the existing structure of the document or the logic of work.

A document can be more information-rich, have layers, cuts, indexes, aspects, versions, states.
This technical ability can be used for different applications and in different aspects - for documentation of few levels of complexity, for collaboration, to increase the functionality or usability of applications.
And in contrast to tag markups, which are mostly organized hierarchically, the layout of data in a SIATM document can be arbitrary, based on needs - technical justifications or for the readability of the source code.

For the basic schema, the complexity of fragment identification is based on the combination of the local uid (2\^36) and the document guid (2\^128). This makes it possible to uniquely identify document fragments on a global scale (total complexity 2^164).
And operate with composite information entities - indexes, collections, complexes, systems, views based on the database of documents using the necessary detailization.

That is, we can talk about a global multidimensional information space, on a global scale and with detailing to a fragment of a document.
This concept is different from today's concept of World Wide Web technology, but can be used as a foundational technology for building it.
