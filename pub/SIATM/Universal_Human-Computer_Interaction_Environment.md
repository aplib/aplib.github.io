## Universal Human-Computer Interaction Environment

SIATM is applicable at all levels, from building models and writing source code, serialization and creating databases, exchange protocols,
to building a high-level user interface. SIATM is proposed as a universal composition language.

In the SIATM paradigm, everything is a document and the document is everything.
In this paradigm, there will be a unified approach to the general concepts of the environment and the possibility of continuous integration of domain specifics and differences into a common system.
As far as it is technically possible. Globalization is implied. If we are talking about a universal environment, we are not limited to the local computer.
