# Informational richness and structural complexity of documents

In SIATM, each document fragment can be associated (or in other words bind) with an additional block containing arbitrary information. 
This binding can be done by structural hierarchy, by strict reference, by namine or algorithmically, by rules.
Thus, it is possible to expand the structure of the document in an arbitrary problem-oriented way, without violating the existing structure of the document or the logic of work.
A document can be information-rich, have layers, cuts, indexes, aspects, versions, states.
