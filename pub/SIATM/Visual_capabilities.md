## Visualization and interactive interaction capabilities of document

In-place view and edit controls, the visual markup of a document, dynamic user interfaces, is another area where you can take advantage of SIATM markup.

Within the framework of the proposed implementation of the platform, each block of text, that is, a fragment, is an actor, a component of the working environment.
A markup block representing a base element can perform a simple markup task on a page.
For component blocks that represent a higher level of abstraction, the block can represent active visual components or interface transformations.
Problem-oriented component blocks can have their own relationship structure and interaction interfaces.
And the possibilities of serialization and state saving will increase the convenience of working with the document.
