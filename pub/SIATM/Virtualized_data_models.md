## Virtualized  data models

The SIATM text markup format enables a more concise and complete description of complex object data models in text form. This is achieved through a structure that is closer to the binary principle of organization.
In a single model description file, programmers can define the data structure, mappings, dependencies, constraints, and model interfaces in a highly readable format due to the openness and specialization of the format.

The compositional capabilities of SIATM, after the implementation of elementary patterns, can be used to create high-level abstractions, virtualized data models. This is the path for which this overlay was created.
