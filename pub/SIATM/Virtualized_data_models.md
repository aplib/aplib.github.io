## Virtualized  data models

The SIATM text markup format enables a more concise and complete description of complex object data models in text form.
In a single model description file, programmers can define the data structure, mappings, dependencies, constraints, and model interfaces in a highly readable format due to the openness and specialization of the format.

The compositional capabilities of SIATM, after the implementation of elementary patterns, can be used to create high-level abstractions, virtualized data models.
Once these elementary patterns are defined, they can be combined in various ways, and combined models could be used to represent complex data structures in a way that is more intuitive, easier to manage and and efficiency at a low level.
