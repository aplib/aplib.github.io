## Compositional capabilities

SIATM is a text compositional markup that has advanced capabilities for building a document structure and endowing markup elements with attributes and auxiliary data, as well as combining elements through semantic elements.

This markup uses the semantics of blocks and embedded DSLs to encode semantic content. The task of markup is to combine blocks and build an effective composition from them.
Since the blocks are sufficiently isolated from each other, different DSLs can be used in the same document, which allows for a very dense and meaningful notation.
This is nothing new, such principles apply, but compatibility issues with block syntax have been resolved in this markup.
