## Compositional capabilities

SIATM is a text compositional markup that has advanced capabilities for building a document structure and endowing markup elements with attributes and arbitary data, as well as combining elements through additional links and relationships.

This markup uses the semantics of blocks and embedded DSLs to encode semantic content. The task of markup is to combine blocks and build an effective composition from them.
Since the blocks are sufficiently isolated from each other, different DSLs can be used in the same document, and at the same time, the combination of contexts allows for more complex grammar, which allows for a very dense and meaningful notation.

This is nothing new, such principles apply, but compatibility issues with block syntax have been resolved in this markup.

Compositional embeddings of domain-specific languages (DSLs) can have a wide range of practical uses in various fields.
