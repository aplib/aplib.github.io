## Compositional capabilities

SIATM is a text compositional markup that has advanced capabilities for building a document structure and endowing markup elements with attributes and auxiliary data, as well as combining elements through semantic elements.

This markup uses borrowed block semantics and uses DSL to encode the semantic content. The markup task is to combine blocks and build an effective composition from them. Since the blocks are sufficiently isolated from each other, different DSLs can be used in the same document, and this allows for a very dense and meaningful notation.
This is nothing new, such principles apply, but block syntax compatibility issues are resolved in this overlay.
